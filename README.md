#  Macroeconomic Data Analysis Project

##  Objective

This project aims to achieve **economic balance** between three key indicators: economic growth, inflation, and unemployment, providing a clear picture of a stable and healthy economy.

##  Selected Countries

The analysis covers **Morocco and Vietnam**.  

Vietnam was chosen because it faced the same challenge as Morocco several years ago: **economic growth without sufficient job creation**.

##  Methodology

The project was carried out in **three main stages**:

1. **Current Situation Visualization**  

   - Collected economic data for the past ten years for each country.  

   - Visualized the trends of the three indicators (growth, inflation, unemployment).  

   - Evaluated whether the current situation meets stability criteria and provided insights/recommendations.

2. **Economic Balance Analysis**  

   - Applied the balancing program to assess how the indicators can be optimized simultaneously.  

   - Simulated scenarios to see how changes in one indicator affect the others.

3. **Balanced Results Visualization**  

   - Created visual representations of the balanced economic state for each country individually.  

   - Focused on understanding the economic status of Morocco and Vietnam separately, without direct comparison.
 
##  Results

- The project helps understand how the three indicators impact economic stability.  

- Comparing Morocco and Vietnam allows drawing insights for potential economic policy improvements.

## ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³ How Vietnam Solved the Problem

Vietnam managed to achieve economic stability by implementing several key strategies:  

1. **Job creation alongside growth**  

   - Attracted new industrial and service investments, especially in manufacturing and technology.  

   - Supported entrepreneurship and small businesses to increase employment.  

2. **Managed inflation policies**  

   - Controlled prices and monitored inflation through strict monetary policies.  

   - Ensured wage growth aligns with productivity.  

3. **Investments in infrastructure and education**  

   - Developed vocational and technical education to prepare youth for the labor market.  

   - Improved infrastructure to support investment and a stable business environment.  

4. **Flexible and adaptable economic policies**  

   - Continuously monitored economic data and adjusted policies according to real indicators of growth, employment, and inflation.

##  Insights / Lessons Learned

Despite applying the same program to both countries, the results differed:  

- **Vietnam** achieved economic stability according to our indicators.  

- **Morocco** still faces challenges, indicating that simply applying the same approach is not enough.  

###  Recommendation

To improve Morocco's economic balance, policies should focus on:  

- Creating more job opportunities alongside economic growth.  

- Implementing measures to control inflation effectively.  

- Monitoring and adjusting policies based on ongoing economic data.  

This project shows that while data-driven programs can provide guidance, each country's unique context requires tailored solutions.
